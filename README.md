Reflection:
Generally, I think this game represents the loop I described, however, it does not work as well when the countdown timer on the zombies is not functional. The player can still envision the idea of the game as the zombie trigger chases them, but the fear that the zombies are meant to create does not translate when they're not fully functional.

This game does answer my question of what speed the zombies must move at to engage the player without losing the challenge of the game. In my testing, I found a good speed for the zombies that allows the player to stay ahead of them, but I think it could be improved with more time.

I would change this game by blocking out more of the track so that players cannot drive off into the open area, creating more of a challenge. I would also fix the other car on the track to be more competitive with the player.

Next, I would like to add another loop from my pitch, collecting supplies on the track to improve your car.
